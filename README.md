Malicious Network Traffic Detection Using Reinforcement Learning
This repository implements a Deep Q-Learning model to identify malicious network traffic. The model is trained using Stable-Baselines3 and leverages reinforcement learning techniques to adaptively detect anomalies in network traffic.

Features
Uses a pre-trained Deep Q-Network (DQN) model to classify network traffic as malicious or benign.
Supports running the model directly without requiring a new environment setup.
Modular code for easy modification and integration with other datasets or architectures.
Requirements
Ensure the following libraries are installed before running the project:

Python 3.8+
stable-baselines3
gymnasium
numpy
scikit-learn
Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Files in the Repository
traffic_dqn_model.zip: Pre-trained DQN model for detecting malicious traffic.
train_model.py: Code for training the DQN model.
evaluate_model.py: Script for testing the trained model on new data.
README.md: Project documentation (this file).
How to Use the Pre-Trained Model
To use the pre-trained model without creating an environment:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-detection-dqn.git
cd traffic-detection-dqn
Load the model and run it on test data:

python
Copy code
from stable_baselines3 import DQN
import numpy as np

# Load the pre-trained model
model = DQN.load("traffic_dqn_model")

# Test data (example observation; replace with real data)
test_data = np.array([0.1, 0.5, ..., 0.3])  # A 20-dimensional vector

# Get predicted action (0: benign, 1: malicious)
action, _ = model.predict(test_data)
print(f"Predicted action: {action}")
Replace test_data with the actual input features you want to classify.

Training the Model
To train the model from scratch:

Prepare the dataset and define the custom Gym environment.
Run train_model.py:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Model Explanation
The model observes a 20-dimensional feature space and takes actions (benign or malicious) based on its policy. It was trained on simulated network traffic with reward signals incentivizing correct classifications.
